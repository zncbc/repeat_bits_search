# repeat_bits_search
This program is used to find duplicate string pairs in data.
This program assumes that most of the data are random, so there will be no expected results for some regular data.
This program may help to random test and find that data is copied incorrectly.
The maximum input data of this program should not exceed 10GB.
This program uses the thread acceleration of openmp and c++11. It occupies 10GB of memory and up to 8 cores. It takes 70 minutes to process 10GB on my computer.
